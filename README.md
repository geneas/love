Odds'n'ends for LÃ¶ve (love2d) projects


### id3.lua:

Module to read ID3 tags from mp3 files.
Contains a single function load(fd) -> *table* or -> *nil, errormsg*

fd must be some kind of file object which implements the method read(n) to read the next <n> bytes from the file.
The file object must initially be positioned at the start of the file. 
The function returns a table containing the following fields (if found):

	CreatedBy [string]
	TrackName [string]
	Artist [string]
	Album [string]
	TrackNumber [number]
	Genre [string]
	Year [number]
	Length [in seconds]




### app_debug.apk:

A slightly modified Android(ARM) love2d-app.
Adds the following functionality:

*love.filesystem._allowMountingForPath(path, where)*

This is an interface to the physfs function of the same name, which allows any directory in the filesystem to
be mounted for reading.

In addition, this apk checks for and runs */storage/extSdCard/lovegame/main.lua* if no other intent is given.


### lfs.so

Android/love2d build of the luafilesystem library.
